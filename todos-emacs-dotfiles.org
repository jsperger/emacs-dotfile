* TODO visual-fill-column

- Change defaults in lisp file instead of customize
- enable global visual-fill-column
- figure out the correct column width and amount of extra space on the sides I want


* TODO line number
 - fix the scroll issue with variable pitch fonts caused by when line number for the
   current line has more digits than the other line numbers on screen (it
   usually does because current line is absolute and others are relative)
