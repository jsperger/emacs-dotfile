* Major projects
** Create a literate config using org-mode

* Package and Custom Settings
** TODO visual-fill-column

- Change defaults in lisp file instead of customize
- enable global visual-fill-column
- figure out the correct column width and amount of extra space on the sides I want

** TODO line number
 - fix the scroll issue with variable pitch fonts caused by when line number for the
   current line has more digits than the other line numbers on screen (it
   usually does because current line is absolute and others are relative)

** TODO Auctex
 - Move customization from customs.el to lang-tex.el
 -see if anything from CDLaTeX is worth using and remap the keybinds to evil format
*  Notes On Removed Packages
** desktop
Disabled because it doesn't always play nice with elpaca. It seems it'll resume
and load packages associated with the current buffer before the elpaca init
runs.
** fold-dwim-org
Disabled for many months, name is illustrative but don't recall using it.
** org-contrib
